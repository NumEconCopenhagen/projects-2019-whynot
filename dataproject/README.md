Relevance between 30-year morgage bond rates and apartment prices in Copenhagen.
¶
We want to see if there's a significance between the 30-year morgage bond rate in a time series and the real-estate prices for apartment in Copenhagen oveer the last 20 years.

We find the development of apartment prices from DST and fetch the data via API. The development in interest rates are in the file Morgagebond_rates.xlsx.

The project is described in dataProject.ipynb
